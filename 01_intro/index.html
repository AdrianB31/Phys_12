<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are the 3 most interesting final project ideas that I'm proposing
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : Portable Biological Incubator</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

My preferred final project proposal is building a portable biological incubator. The portable biological incubator is essential for detecting bacterial disease for medical spaces in rural areas. As a result, the device consists of a 3D printed cast to hold petri plates, a heat source that incubates the plate to 40C, as well as a carbon dioxide and oxygen gas sensor that measures the gas concentration in the incubator. Furthermore, the 3D printed cast would be separated into two chambers (one for oxygen and the other for carbon dioxide incubation). Controlling the gas levels is critical for regulating the pH of the media on the petri plates to ensure repeatable success of microbial growth, enzyme function, and the stability of cell structure. Laslty, building a portable biological incubator is critical for providing medical care in rural areas or in field hospitals since it maximizes a providers ability to distribute antibioticsâ€”even in the most harsh conditions.

<h4>Idea 2: Automatic Sorter Medical Device </h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

An alternative project is building an automatic medical device sorter, which is comprised of a robotic arm and sensor bucket system. The underlying motivation for the project is for the automatic medical device sorter to utilize a robotic arm to provide accurate sorting of biological specimens in a healthcare setting. The robitc arm and basket system work in tandem to distribute the correct specimen to its desired location in a quick and efficient manner. Moreover, the baskets are connected by a sensor to (1) verify which specimen is placed in them, which provides real-time stock analytics to a personal device, and (2) push the basket out of the holding rack in order to receive the specimen being placed.

<h4>Idea 3: Medical Waste Sensor</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

Another alternative project is creating a medical waste sensor to analyze the volume of waste being placed into the container  is placed or molded ontop of a biohazard container to indicate the level of waste in the container and if it's approaching a dangerous level. The sensor acts in real time for staff to monitor efficiently when to replenish the containers.
