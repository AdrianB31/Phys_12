<h3>Final Project: A Portable Medical Incubator </h3>
The underlying motivation for creating a portbale incubator is to showcase the opportunities available for medical accessability. The incubator is essential for growing organisms in order to diagnose bacterial disease, with the intent to distribute antibiotics to the patient. Currently, the market for portable incubators show a price range between ~$1000 to ~$5000. Although this price range is viewed as affordable in advanced nations accustomed to high medical standards, poor nations—or even poor regions within an advanced economy—are likely not able to take advantage of the most current medical technologies due to the constant strain of balancing finanical priorities. Therefore, my final project showcased that utilziing the most simpliest and cheapest components can yield a functional incubator that enhances medical accessability.

Even though the incubator consisted of a box, which was learned in week 1, the final project slowly began to develop during the microcontroller programming week. During this week, I learned I2C communication and how to intergrate a sensor into the OLED display. The following week, in the 3D design module, I designed a fan to disperse the oxgyen within the incubator.

Thereafter, I committed myself to dedicated the remaining weekly assignments to align with my final project. As such, the electronic inputs module provided an excellent opportunity to learn how to setup and conduct reading experiments with a thermistor.

Below are the components combined to make up the incubator. Surprisingly, the temperature reached a high of 38.5 C. However, during the presentation fair, the wooden wall warped outwards due to the constant heat.
