<h3>Week 3.1: 3D Design & Printing</h3>

<h4>Assignment: Model and 3D print something</h4>
For this assignment, we were required to 3D print a component for our final project or a small object not made by subtractive methods. Therefore, I decided to 3D print a miniaturized version of a fan for my portable biological incubator. The image on the top left corner is the fan itself; however, since it was scaled down to print ~10 minutes, the fan and support cast are essentially one industinguishable unit. On the other hand, the shell and grill for the fan were able to be scaled down without design flawsâ€”which are pictured in the bottom row. Lastly, the one concern that I found when using PrusaSlicer is that once I generate the gcode for the object, then I must document its exact dimensions because I'm not able to access that information once the scale of an object is manipulated. As a result, even though I got lucky and was able to fit the fan inside of the shell, the fan grill was too large for the shell.

<h4>Assignment: RevoPoint Scanner</h4>
For the second portion of the assignment requirements, we were tasked with scanning an object using the RevoPoint Scanner. Frankly, this task was easier said than done. At first, I wanted to scan the 3D printed fan blade but discovered that the black fillament was unreadable by the scanner. Thereafter, I tried to scan my airpods case but also found that the glossy material on the case wasn't ideal for the scanner. As a result, I scanned the 3D printed holding buckets since the material was bright and coarse. However, I believe it took me well over 20 minutes of scanning to finally achieve a result that was acceptable since the scanner would sometimes duplicate parts of the bucket.
