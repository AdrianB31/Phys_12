<h3>Week 3.1: 3D Design & Printing</h3>

<h4>Assignment: Model and 3D print something</h4>
For this assignment, we were required to 3D print a component for our final project or a small object not made by subtractive methods. Therefore, I decided to 3D print a miniaturized version of a fan for my portable biological incubator. The image on the top left corner is the fan itself; however, since it was scaled down to print ~10 minutes, the fan and support cast are essentially one industinguishable unit. On the other hand, the shell and grill for the fan were able to be scaled down without design flaws—which are pictured in the bottom row. Lastly, the one concern that I found when using PrusaSlicer is that once I generate the gcode for the object, then I must document its exact dimensions because I'm not able to access that information once the scale of an object is manipulated. As a result, even though I got lucky and was able to fit the fan inside of the shell, the fan grill was too large for the shell.

<h4>Assignment: RevoPoint Scanner</h4>
For the second portion of the assignment requirements, we were tasked with scanning an object using the RevoPoint Scanner. Frankly, this task was easier said than done. At first, I wanted to scan the 3D printed fan blade but discovered that the black fillament was unreadable by the scanner. Thereafter, I tried to scan my airpods case but also found that the glossy material on the case wasn't ideal for the scanner. As a result, I scanned the 3D printed holding buckets since the material was bright and coarse. However, I believe it took me well over 20 minutes of scanning to finally achieve a result that was acceptable since the scanner would sometimes duplicate parts of the bucket. Furthermore, even though the object was coarse and garish, the scanner still had an issue with capturing every aspect of the object when it was rotated. Therefore, once the final scanned image was achieved, there were numerous holes that had to be filled. In fact, after filling the holes on the brim of the bucket, I ran across an issue that didn't allow me to detect an obvious hole on the inside of the bucket—even though it was technically part of the detected hole section of the brim.

<h4>Assignment: Final Project Update with Timeline, Goals, and Required Material</h4>
Here is an update on my final project ambitions for the portable biological incubator:

<h6>Timeline</h6>
The timeline consists of 3D printing the shell, incubation chamber, component holders, and working components. Therefore, I expect several hours (most likely requiring overnight printing) to be dedicated on the 3D printer to actually print each object—and not including the assembly. However, I can realistically be finished done printing all objects within 3-5 days (accounting for printing errors and issues). Thereafter, I need to assemble each component which could take another day or two. Lastly, I need to wire, establish the circuitry, and code. I expect the coding aspect to take the longest, which could last between 5-7 days. 

<h6>Goals and Required Material</h6>
My goal is create a functioning portable biological incubator. As a result, I will need a heating element to maintain a temperature between 35C-37C, as well as a DHT 11 and gas sensor to detect the temperature, humidity and CO2 & O2 levels within the chambers—implied within this requirement is also the CO2 and O2 gas canisters. In addition, a peristaltic pump is required to maintain humidity within the CO2 chamber. Moreover, depending on the efficiency of the fan that I create, I may need to acquire a fan within the lab—but this is for a worst case scenario. In order to monitor the operational efficiency of the incubator, I will also need an OLED screen. Finally, to power the system, I will need a litium ion battery.  

<h6>Tentative Bill of Materials</h6>
DHT 11 = ~$2
<br>
Heating Element = $~11 or free if there are some in the lab
<br>
Litium Ion Battery = $15 or free if there are some in the lab
<br>
Door Sealer = ~$5-$10 (depending on size) or free if there are some in the lab
<br>
Peristaltic Pump = ~$10 or free if there are some in the lab
