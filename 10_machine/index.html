<h3>Weeks 5.2-7: Machine Building</h3>

<h4>Assignment: Build a Drawing Robot</h4>
For this assignment, Leo, Emma, Nick, and I created a drawing robot that extruded frosting. The setup included 3 stepper motors, a syringe, a 3-D printed syringe holder, as well as various pre-given components that included a metal guide rail and 3-D printed holding components. Our largest challenges arose when trying to merge all 3 stepper motors to function in unison. First, when trying to calibrate the x-axis, the stepper motor would vibrate uncontrolably and cause the mechanism to not move along the x-axis. However, after debugging the issue, we discovered that the incorrect pin was usedâ€”alleviating the issue. 
<br>
<br>
Afterwards, our next challenge was having the stepper motor drive the syringe in way that caused a constant extrusion of the frosting. Similar to the previous challenge, our stepper motor would also vibrate and not cause any rotation. However, we discovered the issue lied within the code itself, and not from the hardware. Therefore, we recoded the function which led to a constant torque being applied to the syringe. 
<br>
<br>
After determining the stepper motors and code functions, we tried incorporting the limit switches into the circuit. However, when trying to do so, either the limit switches or the code for the limit switches caused the previous x-and-y-axes code to malfunction.
